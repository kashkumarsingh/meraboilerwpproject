                            <p>The best feature of vaillant boilers is that they constantly show you the water pressure. The system keeps monitoring the pressure of the water and if it falls below the required pressure, it will show a F22 error.</p>
                            <p class="mt-4">The digital display will show the error and you must call in Vaillant boiler repair in London to fix the error as soon as possible. It is important to know that if you have been using the boiler for years, it will definitely show a decrease in pressure and that is fixable too.</p>
                            <p class="mt-4">However, if the decrease in pressure is not gradual but is sudden, then there is certainly an issue that needs to be addressed. The most possible defect might be a leakage in the boiler.</p>
                            <p class="mt-4">If you don’t know much about boilers, do not try to identify the problem on your own as gas leakages are not easy to manage and can be hazardous for health too.</p>

                            <p>Flow is the rate at which the water flows out of your taps and shower etc. It simply means that the water flow is slow and is not as it should be. This happens when there is an issue with the heating system and the open-vent system needs to be opened and exmained to resolve the issue. It can be due to stuck up debris too. Thus, an engineer can look into it deeply.</p>
