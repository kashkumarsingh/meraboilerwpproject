                                boilers make utilization of the heat they generate smarter by burning fuels like oil or
                                gas. As it demands less heat from the burner, it is efficient.</p>

                            <p>Now, this is where the condensing boiler differs from the old conventional one that you
                                might own at this moment; its way of functioning.A condensing boiler utilises some of
                                the heat, generated by the gases to heat the water. On the other hand, a non-condensing
                                boiler, it wastes the heat that is generated through the gases and fuel. Thus, the major
                                difference between the two is on the basis of how they work and this is what makes
                                condensing boilers more efficient.</p>
                            <p class="mt-4">All the modern units of boilers are condensing boilers. Thus, if your old
                                boiler is done and dusted with, then make sure that you opt for a condensing boiler now.
                                It not only helps you save energy but is also more reliable and durable. We also offer

                            <p>All the boilers manufactured from 2005 onwards are condensing boilers. People did not
                                have much knowledge back then and didn't bother much regarding the type of boiler they
                                were buying. However, with the passage of time, more and more people are worried as to
                                whether they have a condensing boiler or not.</p>
                            <p class="mt-4">Firstly, you can give us a call if you have done your boiler installation
                                and we can let you know whether your boiler is condensing or conventional.</p>
                            <p class="mt-4">Secondly, if your boiler has been installed in late 2005 or after it, then
                                it is definitely condensing as the market did not sell non-condensing boilers after
                                that.</p>
                            <p class="mt-4">However, many people might have bought the non-condensing one too. Thus, you
                                can call us at Mera Boiler and we can come along to help you differentiate between the
                                type of boiler you own.</p>
