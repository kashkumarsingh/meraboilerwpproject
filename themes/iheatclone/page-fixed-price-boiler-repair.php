                    But if we generally have to discuss a boiler repair price and how much does it cost on an average,e

                    should one be planning to spend on it?
                </p>
                <p> Well, as boilers have never been an easy investment, it is important to understand that it's repair
                    wouldn't be cheap as well. If a company is offering you a very cheap repair price quotation; make
                    sure you do a lot of research on it, before opting for that service. This is because they might not
                    be professional or well-trained and would leave your boiler in a worse condition than before. You

                    boiler repair service.</p>

                        <p>The boiler repair price does vary depending on the damage that has been done to it. Many
                            companies, like ours, have fixed prices for each type of damage. If it is fully damaged, the
                            repair will require more pence. If the damage is limited, the costs will be lowered.
                            However, the price range begins from £150 and goes up to £400, depending on the seriousness
                            of the damage. You wouldn't get a good and professional repair service in the market,
                            costing you anything less than £130 or minimum £120. The well-reputed ones are usually
                            quoting £150 for minor issues. However, if the trouble is huge and it requires days to get
                            fixed, then you must expect to pay up to £400 too.</p>
                        <p>It is certainly impossible to get an exact figure from each company. Let say, if Mera Boiler
                            tags you £150 for fixing a boiler leakage, another company might quote you a price of £160
                            or 170 for it. Never expect each company to have the same price as the other. They vary from
                            company to company. However, our rule is to define a specific price tag for each “type” of
                            issue that the boiler might be experiencing so that we can provide a clear quotation to the
                            client at the given spot. This saves them and us the time and energy.</p>
