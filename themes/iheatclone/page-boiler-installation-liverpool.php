                            <p>The most important thing to consider is the reliability of the boiler. It is quite obvious because if a boiler is reliable, you won't have to spend on its repair services again and again. With the help of annual maintenance services, it will definitely stay in good health and last longer too.</p>
                            <p class="mt-4">Surveys show that boiler repair prices have gone up over time and an average repair might cost you £150 or £200 easily. Thus, buying an unreliable boiler that doesn’t function properly, can make things worse for you. It will require repair every now and then and make it challenging for your budget too.</p>
                            <p class="mt-4">Therefore, it is important to invest in a reliable boiler. Do your research before choosing a brand or model for your house or workplace. Pick reliable and well-reputed companies to ensure a long-lasting boiler that doesn’t annoy you every other week.</p>
