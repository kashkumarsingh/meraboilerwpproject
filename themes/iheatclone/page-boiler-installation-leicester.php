            <p class="mt-4">Maintaining your boiler is extremely crucial but sadly, it is one of the most overlooked
                aspects by the majority of the people. Boiler installation Leicester costs a lot and you need a handful
                of investment to get one of the best and energy efficient boilers these days. Boiler repair services are
                not cheap either. Thus, if you do not maintain it properly, it will require repair often and will add up
                to your daily expenses.</p>
            <p class="mt-4"> Therefore, our team of experts at Mera Boiler offer you regular maintenance services along
                with boiler installation Leicester services. You can easily book our heating engineer for bi-annual or
                annual boiler maintenance services too and they will come by to your place, on their own, for a regular
                internal checkup of your heating system. Thus, why take the hassle of getting your boiler repaired again
                and again when you can simply maintain it at an easy budget?</p>

                            <p>We recommend our customers to get the boiler serviced once every year in the beginning.
                                When you get a new boiler installation in Leicester, an annual completel service of the
                                system is enough to maintain it. It helps in stretching its lifespan for good and also
                                helps in keeping its breakdowns in control.</p>
                            <p class="mt-4">Moreover, the boiler manufacturer also provides you with a year or two
                                warranty which helps you further in maintaining it, within a budget. Mera Boiler offers
                                you annual service of the boiler too.</p>
                            <p class="mt-4">Professional heating engineers of our team, inspect your boilers in detail
                                annually to look for any possible issues and resolve them at the given time before they

                            <p>Balancing the radiators is another important step for maintenance. The radiators which
                                are far away from the boiler need to be of the same temperature level, as that of the
                                radiators that are near the boiler. If the ones that are far away are too cool, in
                                comparison to the ones that are near the boiler, then they need to be balanced.</p>
                            <p class="mt-4">Balancing the radiators is not that easy and will require an expert to do
                                so. Thus, it is best to get the balancing done annually too. Or you can always check the
                                temperature levels before winter arrives, so that they are balanced on time.</p>

                            <p>It is very important to keep an eye on the color of the flame. Remember that a properly
                                functioning boiler has a bright blue flame; not a yellow one. If the flame is yellow or
                                orange; it indicates gas leakage. </p>
                            <p class="mt-4">It is not necessary that you do smell the gas leakage as carbon monoxide is
